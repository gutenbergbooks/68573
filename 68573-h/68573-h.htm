<span class="i0">And your scent comes into my windows and door.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your seeds were so tiny, I scarce could conceive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When you came up profusely, one can hardly believe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That blossoms like these, such wee little mites<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could produce in my garden such wonderful sights.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When once you are planted when Spring comes around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Multiplied by hundreds you’d peep through the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awaiting the heat, the Sun and the rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the sweet early summer to grow lovely again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You come every year, you make my heart glad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such beautiful blossoms, how can I be sad?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And drink of your nectar, so softly and gay.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_8">{8}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">It’s a gift from Heaven&#8212;such love to possess;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were our children so sweet, so glad and so merry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cheeks like rose buds, and lips like the cherry.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The trees were but saplings, when we came out here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the Sun have protected us many a year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have grown up so high their branches meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And form a cathedral nave over the street;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the birds in the mornings, their anthems to heav’n raise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Til you would think their throats would burst in their praise.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_10">{10}</a></span><br /></span>

<p>This really happened in April, 1865, in the northern part of the
Atlantic ocean. The ship was an old fashioned sailing vessel and under
ordinary circumstances would have required three to four weeks time from
Bergen, Norway, to Montreal, Canada.</p>

<p>Passengers were compelled to carry enough bread for their entire
families, to last for the whole trip, which of course, would become hard
and dry. Many icebergs have nearly vertical walls, often more than one
hundred feet. These floating mountains of ice sometimes have very
fantastic shapes. It is not safe for a ship to come near one, and it is
no uncommon thing for an iceberg to suddenly turn upside down. How
things have changed since then! One can go the same distance in about
twelve days. We were seven weeks crossing at that time on account of the
anxious and terrible stay in the icebergs.</p>

<p>I’m glad to be here in this great land and to tell you this story of my
youth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_59">{59}</a></span></p>

there, in your home in Seattle, where heat need not give you a care.
Daughter is all settled now in her home so neat, with her husband and
her two children sweet. They left for the country a few days ago, and
left me their son to care for, you know. But daughter got lonesome and
wanted her boy. So dad took his hopeful to her with great joy. Nothing
has happened on this dear little street since the day that you left it,
at least nothing great. The same neighbors sit on their porches at
night, trying to find a breeze, perhaps a stray one, real light. I’ll
close now and hope that these lines will fall into the hands of your
dear self and all. We think of you often in your home far away, and hope
you’ll be well and happy; and say, here’s a kiss, and goodby, and hope
you will find the time to write me; now do be kind.&#8212;Very cordially

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
